# Notes

### The concept of **dependency injection (DI)**
- Components annotated with stereotypes like <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Service</code>, <code>@Repository</code>, etc., indicate their role in the application.
- Dependencies are injected into components using <code>@Autowired</code> annotation on *fields, constructors*, or *setter methods*.
- **During application startup**, Spring scans for components and creates instances of them, managing their lifecycle within the application context.
- Spring resolves dependencies *by looking for matching beans* in the application context and automatically injecting them into dependent components.
- ***Beans are instantiated only once***, and the same object instance is used for all references within the application context.

### Database Connectivity and ORM Essentials in Spring Boot 
- **Java Persistence API (JPA)** is a Java specification for managing relational data in Java applications. It provides a *standard way to map Java objects to relational database tables* and vice versa.
- **Hibernate** is a popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It *implements the JPA specification* and provides additional features and enhancements. Hibernate simplifies the development of database-driven applications by abstracting away the details of database interactions and allowing developers to work with Java objects instead.
- **JPA vs JDBC.** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a lower-level API for interacting with databases in Java applications. It requires writing SQL queries and handling database connections, statements, and result sets manually. JPA, on the other hand, *provides a higher-level abstraction over JDBC*, allowing developers to work with objects and entity relationships instead of directly dealing with SQL.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**  is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systemsâ€”in this case, between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. ORM frameworks like Hibernate automate the *mapping between database tables and Java objects*, allowing developers to work with objects in their code while transparently persisting data to and retrieving data from the database.
- **Data Access Object (DAO)**  is a design pattern used to abstract and encapsulate the access to a data source, such as a database. It provides a uniform interface for accessing and manipulating data, decoupling the business logic from the data access logic. DAOs typically contain methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data entities.
- **Connect to Database using Spring Boot.** To connect to a database, you can configure the database connection properties in the *application.properties* file and use Spring Data JPA repositories to interact with the database.
- **Repository** is typically used as a component responsible for *data access operations*, such as querying, saving, updating, and deleting data from a database or any other data source.
- **Configuration**  refers to the process of *defining and configuring beans, components, and other application settings* in a Spring application context.
